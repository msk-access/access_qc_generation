  Guide on interpreting ACCESS QC workflow output.
---

This section will guide you in how to interpret the output from running the ACCESS QC workflow. The main output from running the ACCESS QC workflow is a [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) report (for both single sample and multiple samples). Each subsection explains certain parts from the MultiQC report.

{% hint style="info" %}
Tip: At the top of each MultiQC report produced by this workflow are three buttons: `Show all`, `Hide tumor`, and `Hide normal`. Each button will show/hide the respective samples from the report so you can more easily review it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Tip: MultiQC comes with a lot of additional usability features that will not be described in this documentation. Please see [MultiQC docs](https://multiqc.info/docs/) for more information.
